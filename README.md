# Skin Disease Detection System

This project is a backend-based Skin Disease Detection system developed using Machine Learning and Flask.

## Project Overview
The system allows users to upload a skin image and returns the predicted skin condition such as acne, dry skin, fungal infection, normal, or oily skin.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- NumPy, Pandas
- TensorFlow / Keras

## Features
- REST API built using Flask
- Image upload endpoint
- Prediction endpoint for skin condition detection
- Scalable backend structure

## API Endpoints
- `GET /` → Check if backend is running
- `POST /predict` → Upload image and get prediction

## Project Status
Currently under development. Model integration and deployment will be added in future updates.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate trained CNN model
- Add frontend interface
- Deploy on cloud (Render / AWS / Heroku)
